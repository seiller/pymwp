This guide has offered only a short introduction to mwp-analysis and
pymwp. For additional details, have a look at:

* [“mwp-Analysis Improvement and Implementation: Realizing Implicit Computational Complexity”](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FSCD.2022.26)  
  Describes theoretical foundations behind pymwp. 

* [“A Flow Calculus of mwp-Bounds for Complexity Analysis”](https://doi.org/10.1145/1555746.1555752)  
  Original mwp-flow analysis technique.

* [Documentation](https://statycc.github.io/pymwp)
  – Includes information about supported C language features, etc.

* [Online demo](https://statycc.github.io/pymwp/demo/) 
  – Run pymwp online on more than 40 examples.
  
* [Source code](https://github.com/statycc/pymwp)
  – pymwp is open source.

* [License](https://github.com/statycc/pymwp/blob/main/LICENSE)
  – pymwp is licenced under GPLv3.
