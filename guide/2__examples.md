# Examples

We now demonstrate use of pymwp on several examples.
Throughout these examples, we will add multiple command line arguments, to ease this presentation.

```
--fin      always runs analysis to completion
--info     reduces the amount of terminal output 
--no_time  omits timestamps
```

For a complete list of available command arguments, run:

```
pymwp --help
```
