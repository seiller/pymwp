# Examples

We now demonstrate use of pymwp on several examples.
To ease the presentation, we will use multiple command line arguments.

* `--fin` --- always run analysis to completion (even on failure)
* `--info` --- reduces amount of terminal output to info level
* `--no_time` --- omits timestamps from output log

For a complete list of available command arguments, run:

```console
pymwp --help
```
