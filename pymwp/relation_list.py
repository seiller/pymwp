        When creating a relations list, specify either `variables` or `relation_list`.

        Specifying a `relation_list` argument, whose value is a list of `Relations`, will
        initialize a `RelationList` containing the provided relations.

        If no `relation_list` argument is provided, the constructor will create a
        relation list with 1 relation, using the provided `variables` to initialize
        that relation.

        See [`RelationList.identity()`](relation_list.md#pymwp
        .relation_list.RelationList.identity) if you want to create a relation list
        containing an identity relation.

        Example:

        Create relation list using specific variables

        ```python
        rel_list = RelationList(['X0', 'X1', 'X2'])

        # Generates a list with 1 relation:
        #
        # 1:      X0    |     +o  +o  +o
        #         X1    |     +o  +o  +o
        #         X2    |     +o  +o  +o
        ```

        Create relation list by providing relations

        ```python
        r1 = Relation(['X0', 'X2'])
        r2 = Relation(['X0'])
        rel_list = RelationList(relation_list = [r1,r2])

        # Generates a list with 2 relations:
        #
        # 1:      X0    |     +o  +o
        #         X2    |     +o  +o
        #
        # 2:      X0    |     +o
        ```

        Arguments:
            variables: list of variables used to initialize
                a relation on relation list.
