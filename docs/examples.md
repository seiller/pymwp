# Examples

pymwp analyzes programs written in C language.
The project repository `c_files` directory contains many examples.


### Program Categories

:material-hand-wave-outline: &nbsp; **Basics**

: Programs performing operations that correspond to simple derivation trees.

:material-infinity: &nbsp; **Infinite** 

: Programs that are assigned matrices that always contain infinite coefficients, no matter the choices.

:octicons-move-to-end-24: &nbsp; **Not Infinite**

: Programs that are assigned matrices that do not always contain infinite coefficients.

:material-circle-outline: &nbsp; **Original Paper**

: Examples taken from or inspired by paper ["A Flow Calculus of mwp-Bounds for Complexity Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.1145/1555746.1555752).

:material-asterisk: &nbsp; **Implementation Paper**

: Examples from paper ["mwp-Analysis Improvement and Implementation: Realizing Implicit Computational Complexity"](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16307/pdf/LIPIcs-FSCD-2022-26.pdf).

:material-dots-horizontal: &nbsp; **Other**

: Other programs of interest.
