# Supported C-Language Features

This section provides a summary of supported C language features pymwp can
analyze. It also lists language features that are in the process of being
implemented and for which implementation is planned.

!!! info "Note on C file parsing"

    pymwp uses pycparser to process the C input file. Any limitation of
    pycparser is also a limitation in pymwp. From
    [pycparser website](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser):
    "pycparser aims to support the full C99 language (according to the
    standard ISO/IEC 9899). Some features from C11 are also supported."

BY default, analysis bypasses unsupported statements and raises a warning.

[^1]: Binary operands must be variables or constants.
[^2]: Loop must be recognizable as "run `X` times" and guard variable `X` cannot occur in body.
