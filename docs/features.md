# Supported C-Language Features 

This section provides a summary of supported C language features pymwp can 
analyze. It also lists language features that are in the process of being 
implemented and for which implementation is planned.

!!! info "Note on C file parsing"
    pymwp uses pycparser to process the C input file. Any limitation of 
    pycparser is also a limitation in pymwp. From
    [pycparser website](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser):
    "pycparser aims to support the full C99 language (according to the 
    standard ISO/IEC 9899). Some features from C11 are also supported."

Analysis will bypass any unsupported statement and raises a warning.

:  ðŸŸ© &nbsp; ready â€” fully implemented and ready to use
