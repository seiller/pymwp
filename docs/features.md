# Supported C-Language Features

This section provides a summary of supported C language features pymwp can
analyze. It also lists language features that are in the process of being
implemented and for which implementation is planned.

!!! info "Note on C file parsing"
pymwp uses pycparser to process the C input file. Any limitation of
pycparser is also a limitation in pymwp. From
[pycparser website](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser):
"pycparser aims to support the full C99 language (according to the
standard ISO/IEC 9899). Some features from C11 are also supported."

BY default, analysis bypasses unsupported statements and raises a warning.

:  ðŸŸ© &nbsp; ready â€” fully implemented and ready to use
:  ðŸŸ§ &nbsp; in progress â€” implementation in progress, but not ready
:  â¬œ &nbsp; planned â€” implementation is in a planning stage

[^1]: Added in version > 0.4.2
[^2]: Binary operands must be variables or constants.
[^3]: Loop must be recognizable as "run `X` times" and guard variable `X` cannot occur in body.
